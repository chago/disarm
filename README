disarm is an ARM/THUMB disassembler.

This project is still in its infancy, and as such it is rather incomplete.
Currently only THUMB is supported, and only a few instructions at that.

Depending on whether i manage to stay interested, it may evolve into a full
decompiler. The first step is to generate an AST...

USAGE

There's no real CLI yet, but this should work for now:

    python3 disarm/thumb.py file
